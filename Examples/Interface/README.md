# Creating Model Interfaces in ACT-R

This repository give some examples of how to create visual interfaces in ACT-R. It provides two models, `lexical.lisp` and `stimulus.lisp`, that interact with either ACT-R's default window or with custom interface, respectively.

The `interface_demo.ipynb` notebook illustrates how the two types of interfaces work.
