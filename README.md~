# Demo ACT-R: Building a Stroop Device and a Stroop model

This is some demo code for the ACT-R class; it shows how to build a
simple, interactive device for an ACT-R model, and it provides
a skeleton for a model.

## Device

The device is written in Python using the new, JSON-RPC based
interface for ACT-R 9 (currently in beta, coded as 7.6 or 7.x).

The device implements the version of the Stroop task used by
Tim Verstynen in his 2014 paper.

## Model

The model is a "response monkey", a basic model that simply clicks
at random when it sees a stimulus.
